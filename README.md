# 110 kV Insulator Maintenance & Monitoring Robot

## Introduction

The project was a joint effort between Team Abhiyantra and TATA Power Company
Ltd., who collaborated closely throughout the development process. The 110kV
Switchyard Maintenance and Monitoring Robot is a highly advanced robotic system
developed with the objective of revolutionising the maintenance and monitoring of
switchyards. As a critical component of the power generation and distribution
infrastructure, the switchyard requires regular maintenance and monitoring to ensure
its safe and efficient operation. The traditional manual maintenance process involves
significant risks to the safety and health of workers who have to work at great heights
and in difficult conditions. Therefore, the primary objective of this project is to provide
a safer and more efficient solution for maintaining and monitoring the switchyard.

#### The robot consists of two major components:

1. Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm

This arm design has been used due to its range of motion. This design provides a 180Â° degree of freedom and a radius of 1.5m. A high power water jet is placed at the end effector which is used to clean and maintain the insulators.

2. Locomotion

The locomotion's design enables it to have great maneuverability. It is powered by a 48V BLDC motor which helps the robot to traverse over rough terrains.

## Electrical System Design

#### The electrical design consists of AC and DC components:

1. AC:

240V AC supply is used to control the relays for the water jet power and the soap dispenser valve.

2. DC:

There are two voltage levels used in this robot. They are 48V and 24V. The 48V is used to operate the locomotion BLDC motor. The 24V is used for DC injection braking, SCARA DC motors, cooling fans and status lights.
